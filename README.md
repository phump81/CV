I am a recent graduate of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), an intensive software development bootcamp, seeking my first professional role as a software developer. Following a decade and a half of working in technical theatre, I decided it was time for a change, and chose to apply my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and an almost frustrating attention to detail, to a career in tech.

## Technical Experience
#### Makers Academy (June 2020 to September 2020) - Full-Stack Software Development Bootcamp.
A four-month, full time, intensive Bootcamp prioritising TDD, BDD, OOP and Agile processes. It has equipped me to TDD anything, program fluently, debug anything, model anything, refactor anything and most importantly it focussed on learning to learn.
A few examples of the projects I worked on during the course are below;

## Projects

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

At Makers we were pushed to grow and improve our developer skills on a daily basis. Principles laid out early in the course made it possible for me to learn new languages and frameworks with greater ease. Before Makers, I had recently made the move into theatre automation, and had to learn to programme, operate and troubleshoot a system that was completely new to me.

#### Team Player

In one of my most recent roles, I became the deputy head of an established  team of nine people, comprised of six nationalities, spanning four continents. My career is full of examples of being thrust into various teams, fulfilling many different roles. At Makers, we did three group projects, as well as daily pairing, and I like to think that I contributed positively to each one, every day. 

#### Problem Solver

Throughout my time at Makers, and also my career in technical theatre, fresh problems were always presenting themselves. No matter what that may be, I am always keen to find the best solution. I also do logic puzzles in my spare time.
